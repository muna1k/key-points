# key-points of Docker
1.	**Containerization:**
	•	Docker packages applications and dependencies into lightweight, portable containers.
2.	**Images:**
•	Docker images are standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run an application.•	A Dockerfile contains instructions for building Docker images, specifying the environment and runtime.
3.	**Dockerfile:**
•	A Dockerfile contains instructions for building Docker images, specifying the environment and runtime.
4.	**Containers:**
•	Instances of Docker images that run as isolated processes, sharing the host OS kernel.
5.	**Registry:**
•	Docker images are stored in registries like Docker Hub, facilitating sharing and distribution.
6.	**Docker Compose:**
•	Tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML configuration.
7.	**Orchestration:**
•	Docker Swarm and Kubernetes orchestrate container deployment, scaling, and monitoring.
8.	**Volumes:**
•	Docker volumes persist data generated and used by containers, providing shared storage.
9.	**Networking:**
•	Docker provides networking features for container communication and port mapping.
10.	**CLI (Command Line Interface):**
•	Docker is controlled through a command-line interface for building, running, and managing containers.
11.	Security:
•	Follow Docker security best practices, such as using minimal base images and restricting container privileges.
12.	Cross-Platform Compatibility:
•	Docker containers run consistently on any system supporting Docker.
